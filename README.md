# Lumira.viz-ext.3DWorld

Hi everyone. This repository is a viz extension for SAP Lumira.
It displays a 3D world where you can map your longitude/latitude data, as well as put two indicators on them (size/color).

This explanation will be updated as I update the code.

For the moment, let's viz :) !

**Fix**
- 11/11/2015 : Adding multiple times this extension in one story page now works as exepected

**Current limitations**
- There is no legend for the extension, I've planned to make one tho (or maybe some kind of *infowindow*)
- Even if technically the globe supports an infinity of points, the performance starts to decrease above 250/300 points. The performance decreases even faster as you put several times the extension in a Lumira Story.
