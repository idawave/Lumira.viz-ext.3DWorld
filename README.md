# Lumira.viz-ext.3DWorld

Hi everyone. This repository is an viz extension for SAP Lumira.
It displays a 3D world where you can map your longitude/latitude data, as well as put two indicators on them (size/color).

This explanation will be updated as I update the code.

For the moment, let's viz :) !
